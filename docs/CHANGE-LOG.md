## History

### 2026-10-09 — v0.1.0 — Project reset and re-baseline

**Context.** The repository previously contained a complete earlier iteration of this
project (brand `NORDVIK`) that was erased in commits `1bb7969` ("erase content") and
`64550f3` ("erase all"). The founder chose a **fresh start**: re-plan the project from zero
rather than resume the prior code, reusing the prior *documentation conventions* because
they were sound.

**Decisions taken in this baseline.**

- Fresh start; prior work treated as discarded (recoverable at `d23c8de` if ever needed).
- Brand **LYSHEIM** adopted (`ADR-0003`).
- Monorepo structure with `backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/` (`ADR-0001`).
- Documentation and change-control convention reused (`ADR-0002`).
- Working agreement adopted: small increments, quality gates, unit tests, local commit
  without push, scenario-based QA, seeding, environment segregation (`ADR-0004`, see
  `WORKING-AGREEMENT.md`).
- Market changed to **international, USD** (the prior iteration targeted Indonesia/IDR).
- Stack updated to **Django 6** with an explicit async + built-in Tasks policy (see
  `PLAN.md` §5).
- Free-tier deploy targets fixed: Render (backend), Vercel (frontend), Supabase (Postgres),
  Upstash (Phase 2).

**Impact.** `PLAN.md` baselined at v0.1.0. Stage 0 (foundation) and Stage 1 (business
strategy) documentation produced. No application code written yet.
